In cognizant i'm working Waymo process.
In the waymo process i'll work in two projects 
1. Waymo Fused 
2. crowd Compute
Mainly in waymo process 


***Describe a challenging project you worked on. waymo process.
Situation: "While working on an autonomous vehicle project, we faced a significant challenge during the integration of new sensor technology into our existing fleet.
            The goal was to enhance the vehicle's perception capabilities, but we had a tight deadline due to an upcoming demonstration to stakeholders."
Task     : "As a member of the engineering team, my task was to lead the integration of these sensors, ensuring they worked seamlessly with our 
            existing software and hardware systems while maintaining safety standards."
Action   : "I initiated a series of collaboration sessions with the hardware and software teams to understand the compatibility issues we faced.
            We developed a prototype integration plan and set up a rapid testing environment to evaluate performance in real-time. I also coordinated with the safety 
            team to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements. To expedite the process, we implemented an agile methodology, allowing us to adapt quickly to any unforeseen issues."
Result   : "Despite the challenges, we successfully integrated the new sensors ahead of the demonstration. The improved perception capabilities significantly
            enhanced the vehicle's ability to navigate complex environments. The demonstration received positive feedback from stakeholders,
            leading to further investment in our project. This experience taught me the importance of cross-team collaboration and adaptability in high-pressure situations."
