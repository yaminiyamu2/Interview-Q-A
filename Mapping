***what is map?
A map is a visual representation of an area that shows geographical features, such as landforms, roads, bodies of water, and boundaries. 
Maps can be two-dimensional, like:
1.traditional paper maps,
2.interactive digital versions. 
They serve various purposes, including navigation, planning, and understanding spatial relationships.
Maps can also represent different types of information, like political, physical, or thematic data.

***what is mapping?
Mapping is the process of creating a map or representation of an area, which involves collecting, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data.
This can include geographic information like terrain, landmarks, and infrastructure, as well as abstract data, such as demographics or environmental conditions.
Mapping helps in understanding relationships between different locations and can be used for navigation, urban planning, resource management, and more.
It often involves techniques like cartography, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), and data visualization.

***What is navigations? 
Navigation is the process of determining one's position and planning a route to reach a destination. It involves using various tools and techniques to guide travel, 
whether by land, sea, or air. Navigation can include:
1.Traditional Methods: Using maps, compasses, and landmarks.
2.Technological Aids: GPS (Global Positioning System) and digital mapping apps that provide real-time location and directions.
3.Celestial Navigation: Using the positions of stars and celestial bodies, mainly used in maritime contexts.
4.Wayfinding: Understanding and using the environment to orient oneself, often in urban settings.
Effective navigation ensures safe and efficient travel, whether for personal, commercial, or recreational purposes.

***What is the defference between Map and Mapping?
The difference between "map" and "mapping" lies in their definitions and functions:
1.Map: A map is a visual representation of an area, displaying geographical features, landmarks, and spatial relationships. 
       It can be a physical or digital artifact used for navigation or understanding a particular region.
2.Mapping: Mapping is the process of creating a map. It involves gathering, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data to produce a representation of an area. 
           This process can include various techniques, such as cartography and GIS.
In summary, a map is the final product, while mapping refers to the activities involved in producing that product.
